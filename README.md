# DataAnalysisProject_IncomePredictions
###### Given census data containing continuous and discrete values on individuals and their incomes, 
###### we were tasked with preprocessing and cleaning data building different algorithms, then using 
###### several models to test which resulted in most accurate classification. 

##### To run code open the algorithms.py and functions.py files in the same directory. 
##### Use command python3 algorithms.py 

##### Our project report is in the Data_Mining_Report.pdf 

##### *Note install any missing libraries*
